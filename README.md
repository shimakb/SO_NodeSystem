# SO_NodeSystem
A generative, force-driven node system created with p5.js (WEBGL).

This project simulates a group of nodes moving freely in three-dimensional
space. As nodes approach each other, temporary connections form and a
dense network emerges.

As the network reaches higher density, internal tension causes the structure
to destabilize, pushing nodes outward and breaking the connections.
This results in a continuous loop of attraction, saturation, and repulsion.

The work explores self-organization, instability, and cyclical behavior
in spatial networks.

**Tools**
- p5.js
